# matplotlib-challenge

In an animal study done by a Pharmaceutical company we are given the data for 250 mice that were treated through a  variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were recorded and monitored over the course of that time.

Using the Matplotlib and Pandas libraries in the Python script I was tasked with the following:

    Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
    
    Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over   time for each treatment.
    
    Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment       (Survival Rate)
    
    Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45     days.
